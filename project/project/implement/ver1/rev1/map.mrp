  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Total REAL time to MAP completion:  3 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   3 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator M1<9>1 failed to merge with F5
   multiplexer M2<22>_f5.  There is a conflict for the FXMUX.  The design will
   exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator M1<3>1 failed to merge with F5
   multiplexer M2<28>_f5.  There is a conflict for the FXMUX.  The design will
   exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator M1a<3>1 failed to merge with F5
   multiplexer M1a<3>_f5.  There is a conflict for the FXMUX.  The design will
   exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator M1<19>_SW1 failed to merge with F5
   multiplexer U3/Mmux_M1_mux0000_83_SW0_f5.  There is a conflict for the FXMUX.
    The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator U3/blue<0>21 failed to merge with F5
   multiplexer selector/green<1>11_f5.  There is a conflict for the FXMUX.  The
   design will exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net U3/B_and0000 is sourced by
   a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <btn<0>_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <btn<1>_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <btn<2>_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network upBTN has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 47 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   aBTN,
   rightBTN,
   leftBTN,
   downBTN,
   hill1<7>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   8 block(s) optimized away
   1 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

The signal "t/N0" is sourceless and has been removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC
GND 		t/XST_GND
VCC 		t/XST_VCC
GND 		tank1font10s/GND
VCC 		tank1font10s/VCC
GND 		tank1font1s/GND
VCC 		tank1font1s/VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
