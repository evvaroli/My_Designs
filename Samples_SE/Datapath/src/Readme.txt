DATAPATH is a design that shows the data path in a hypothetical device.

The purpose of this design is to demonstrate application of Block Diagram Editor 
for creation of synthesisable FPGA-based designs.

The designs uses all design entries supported by Active-HDL tools:
-VHDL Code
-Block Diagram
-State Machine Diagram

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

The device processes (adds and subtracts) two sequences of numbers, for each sequence
the separated numbers (sums) are created.
Next, numbers are compared with each other, the bigger one is a result of the processing.

INPUTS:	
DATA_IN(SIZE:0) - input data bus, SIZE: specifies its width
CODE(11:0) - specifies the amount of counted digits:
	CODE(11:8) 	- the amount of numbers in the first sequence (numbers will be added)
	CODE(7:4)	- the amount of clock events between the first and the second sequence
	CODE(3:0)	- the amount of numbers in the second sequence (numbers will be added, and then subtracted)
START - high logical value ("1") starts processing
RESET - resets all data flow registers and sets the control module to its initial state
CLK - clock signal

OUTPUTS:
DATA_OUT(SIZE:0) - data output 
OVL - high logical value ("1") indicates the arithmetical operation overflow
