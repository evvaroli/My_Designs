This design shows implementation of a digital low pass filter.
The PLI interface is used for (VHDL, Verilog, EDIF)-C/C++ co-simulation.

The output value (NO) is described by the following Laplace transform:

NO(s)=NI(s)/(1+sT), where: T = 2^n/fi

The algorithm:
The design is based upon two programmable frequency dividers and one reversible counter.
A number representing the value of a digitized signal is passed to the NI input, which
controls the first frequency divider (PFDIV-U2). Thus, the frequency of the output
signal from the (PFDIV-U2) divider is a linear function of the NI value. The signal
is passed to the count-up input of the reversible counter RC that operates as an integrator.
The counter output (NO) controls the other programmable frequency divider (PFDIV-U4).
The output of the (PFDIV-U4) divider is connected to the countdown input of the reversible
counter, thus forming a feedback loop. Both frequency dividers are fed with clock
pulses of the same frequency but different phases. This prevents from occurring
impulses on the inputs of the reversible counter.
