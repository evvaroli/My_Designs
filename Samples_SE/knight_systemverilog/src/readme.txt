DESCRIPTION:
	The design simulates moving of knight on the chessboard. The knight can be
	present only once on each field on the chessboard. Size of the chessboard
	can be changed to any size.

	NOTE: The change of chessboard's size is possible, but it forces longer time
	      of simulation. The bigger chessboard's size, the longer simulation time.

SIMULATION:
	Simulation of the design can be performed by one of the macro files.
    Simulation results can be observed in one of the following:
	Console window, Memory View window and result files obtained during simulation.

MACRO DO FILES:
	- runme_flat_5x5.do - runs project with "flat" main task. Chessboard's dimensions
		are set to 5x5 squares. Switch '+define+disp' means that messages about
		progress in finding solution will be displayed in the Console and written
		to the result file.

	- runme_flat_8x8.do - runs project with "flat" main task. Chessboard's dimensions
		are set to 8x8 squares. Switch '+define+disp' does not exists, so it means
		that messages about progress in finding solution will not be displayed in
		the Console nor written to the result file. If it would so, the simulation
		would last very long and the result file generated, would be very large.
		The chessboard's dimensions are set by vsim's switch -G.

	- runme_recursive_5x5.do - runs project with recursive main task. Chessboard's
		dimensions are set to 5x5 squares. Switch '+define+disp' means that
		messages about progress in finding solution will be displayed in the Console
		and written to the result file.

	- runme_recursive_8x8.do - runs project with recursive main task. Chessboard's
		dimensions are set to 8x8 squares. Switch '+define+disp' does not exists,
		so it means that messages about progress in finding solution will not be
		displayed in the Console nor written to the result file. If it would so,
		simulation would last very long and generated result files would be very
		large. The chessboard's dimensions are set by vsim's switch -G.

RESULT FILES:
	- res_flat_char.txt 	  - file generated by knight_flat.v when macro
				    runme_flat_5x5.do is executed.
	- res_flat_digit.txt 	  - file generated by knight_flat.v when macro
				    runme_flat_5x5.do is executed. 
	- res_flat_enum.txt  	  - file generated by knight_flat.v when macro
				    runme_flat_5x5.do is executed. 
	- res_recursive_char.txt  - file generated by knight_recursive.v when
				    macro runme_recursive_5x5.do is executed.
	- res_recursive_digit.txt - file generated by knight_recursive.v when macro
				    runme_recursive_5x5.do is executed.
	- res_recursive_enum.txt  - file generated by knight_recursive.v when macro
				    runme_recursive_5x5.do is executed.

SOURCE FILES:
	- knight_flat.sv - model with flat main task. Chessboard's dimensions
				    can be set by switch -G in asim command. Default
				    dimentions are set to 5x5 squares.
	- knight_recursive.sv - model with recursive main task.
				    Chessboard's dimensions are set by switch -G in asim
				    command. Default dimentions are set to 5x5 squares.
