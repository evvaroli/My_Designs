QLOGIC_VOICE is a sample design based on the guidelines
provided by the tutorial included in QuickWorks 

PART: QL3025 Package: PQ208

DESCRIPTION:
	The goal of this design is to show how to use
	Active-HDL for VHDL designs intended for QuickWorks.
	The timing simulation data has been produced by QuickWorks programs.
	Vital 3.0 Compliant simulation option has been selected. 

FILES:

 Functional:
	VOICEPKG.VHD  - package with constant declaration
	VOICE.VHD     - a top-level structural VHDL program
	VOICE_TB.VHD  - testbench for functional simulation
	
 Timing:
	VOICE_T.VHQ   - a structural VHDL program based on QLPRIMS library
	VOICE.SDF     - timing data for simulation
	VOICE_T_TB.VHD  - testbench for timing simulation

 Macros:
	FUNCTIONAL.DO - macro file for functional simulation
	TIMING.DO     - macro file for timing simulation
 

 Simulation results:
	PATTERN.FUN - an output file with the functional simulation results
	PATTERN.TIM - an output file with the timing simulation results

For functional pre-synthesis simulation execute macro functional.do.
The simulation results are written to file functional.txt

For timing post-implement simulation execute macro timing.do.
The simulation results are written to file timing.txt.
