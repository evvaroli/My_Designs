<h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3>

<p>
	The FFT_ANALYSIS_MATLAB_TUTORIAL is a simple DSP design for the accompanying "Using MATLAB Interface" tutorial from the on-line documentation.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of this design is to demonstrate the use of the Active-HDL CoSimulation Interface for MATLAB&reg.
</p>

<p>
	MATLAB&reg; software can be downloaded from the MathWorks website <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">www.mathworks.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The design consist of an FFT design described in VHDL. The tutorial shows how to use a set of foreign functions and procedures provided by the Active-HDL CoSimulation Interface for MATLAB. These functions allow to move a part of the testbench to MATLAB environment and use its analysis and visualization capabilities.

<p>
	The VHDL part of testbench being created during tutorial generates FFT control signals (start, reset, clk, ce, inv) and FFT input 2kHz square wave, instantiates FFT entity, and uses functions responsible for control over MATLAB workspace and data transfer between Active-HDL and MATLAB workspace.<br>
	The MATLAB part of testbench takes FFT input 2kHz square wave generated by VHDL part, multiplies each sample by window function coefficient and gives it back to VHDL part in order to drive FFT input. It also takes this input, calculates FFT using MATLAB built-in fft() function and compares calculated FFT with outputs of FFT model written in VHDL. Finally, it draws plots for data visualization.
