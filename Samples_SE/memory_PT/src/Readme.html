<h1>'Memory_PT' Project Demonstrating Protected Types in VHDL</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>


This design demonstrates the usage of protected types in VHDL 2002 to
create model of memory.<br>


To ensure efficient use of workstation physical memory during
simulation, dynamic memory allocation and sparse arrays are used for
modeling.<br>


The use of access types is totally encapsulated within protected type
to allow easy model creation by simple calls of protected type methods.<br>

<h2>Description</h2>

<h3>'sparse' Package</h3>

This package contains just one element: protected type <i><b>sparse_arr_type</b></i> with 4 methods:<br>

<ul>

  <li>init</li>

  <li>store</li>

  <li>recall</li>
  <li>dump</li>

</ul>

The <i>init</i> method has one boolean parameter <i>memdmp</i> and should be called once
during simulation to initialize memory object (create dynamic linked
list&nbsp;structure representing memory). If <i>memdmp</i> is set to <i>True</i>, memory contents can be dumped into console by calling <i>dump</i> method.<br>

The <i>store</i> method with <i>address</i> and <i>value</i> parameters allows storing given value at given address in the memory structure. Cells are created dynamically as needed.<br>

The <i>recall</i> method with <i>address</i> parameter retrieves
contents of the cell with given address. If the cell was not previously
accessed, it is created with default value inside.<br>
The <i>dump</i> method without parameters should be called to dump the
entire memory contents (all dynamically created&nbsp;cells) into the
console. Memory contents is printed using the following format: <i><font color="#3333ff"><b>time</b></font>; HEAD=&gt; <font color="#3333ff"><b>addr1</b></font>:<font color="#3333ff"><b>contents</b></font> -&gt;<font color="#3333ff"><b>addr2</b></font>:<font color="#3333ff"><b>contents</b></font>&nbsp; ... -&gt;TAIL.</i><br>

<br>

Record type representing one cell and matching pointer type are defined
in the protected type body, which also declares two pointers (one for
remembering beginning of the list structure, the other for storing
location of currently processed cell) and two internal subprograms (one
for finding cell with given address, the other for inserting new cell
at given location).<br>

<h3>'memory' Unit</h3>

The <i>memory</i> entity with <i>behavior</i> architecture use <i>sparse</i> package to declare <i>mem</i> shared variable of <i>sparse_arr_type</i> type to model memory structure.<br>

The architecture contains two processes:<br>

<ul>

  <li><b>memini</b> - initializing memory via <i>mem.init</i> call and suspending;</li>

  <li><b>synch</b> - performing memory read (<i>mem.recall</i>) or memory write (<i>mem.store</i>) on rising clock edge, and optional memory dump on falling clock edge.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Testbench</h3>

The testbench for the project (<i>memory_tb.vhdl</i>) instantiates
memory component and then writes values to 5 memory cells in
non-sequential order. After last write testbench switches to reading:
all previously written cells are read in sequential order, then read
from the address that was not previously written is attempted.<br>

<br>

<h2>Simulation</h2>
Use <i>run_sim.do</i> to compile and simulate the project. In addition
to interface signals, waveform created by the macro will also display
internal SIZE field of the memory structure to let the operator see how
memory cells are crated as needed during simulation.<br>
