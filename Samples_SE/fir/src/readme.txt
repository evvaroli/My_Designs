DESCRIPTION:
	The project presents the use of waveform commands to check RTL implementation of a simple 7-tap FIR filter.
	The FIR filter is designed with a simple, basic structure of flip-flops, multipliers and an adder.
	The multiplication is implemented by using a ROM memory.
	
	The reference filter output is generated by expression made from registered outputs of the filter.


OPERATION:
	By executing the runme_ver.do or runme_vhd.do macros, the following operations are performed:
	The first simulation run generates a reference simulation database for the expression.
	The filter output as well as signals used in the expression are selected in the waveform and saved to files by using the wavedump command.
	Additionally, waveform cursors define the time range which limits the expression to a specific time window.
	The positions of the cursors are saved as well.
	Next, an expression template file (VHDL or Verilog) along with a macro are generated based on the dump files.
	Executing the generated macro, both RTL filter simulation and expression simulation is performed.
	Comparison of expression (expression) with the filter output (/tb/dut/outp) verifies the implementation.

LANGUAGE:
	Verilog, VHDL
